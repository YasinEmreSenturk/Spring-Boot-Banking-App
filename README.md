#Spring Boot Banking Project
As my first venture into Spring Boot development, this project represents a significant milestone in my journey as an intern engineer. Working alongside a dedicated collaborator, we've created a core banking application that handles essential functionalities such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and account management with precision and reliability.

But this is just the beginning.

In the upcoming release, weâ€™re planning to transform this basic application into a comprehensive banking solution. Expect an intuitive user interface, seamless user experience, and additional features that will elevate the project to a more advanced level, making it a true reflection of modern banking needs.

Upcoming Enhancements
User Interface: A sleek, intuitive web-based interface to enhance user interaction.
Advanced Features: Additional banking functionalities, including transaction history, transfer between accounts, and more.
Enhanced Security: Implementing advanced security measures to safeguard user data and transactions.
Stay tuned for these exciting updates as we continue to evolve this project into a more comprehensive banking solution!
